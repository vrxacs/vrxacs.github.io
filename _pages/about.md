My passion is problem-solving and applying my knowledge to tackle tough engineering challenges and push the boundaries of cutting-edge technology. I’ve pursued this passion in a variety of ways, including:

- Doing research in the area of fairness and explainability of machine learning models for CognitiveScale’s Certifai product. As part of a team, I took research code and productionized it, as well as improved the CERTIFAI algorithm in multiple ways; 
- For my thesis, using machine learning algorithms to create an agent that learned to play various games through repeated self-play;
- Working on and leading various complex software engineering projects at Globalscape, such as a High Availability server solution and a software for the secure centralized management and automation of hundreds of thousands of agents from a single server;
- Doing research work on a biophysics project aiming to understand the dynamics of the protein responsible for Alzheimer’s;

In order to be an effective problem-solver, I’ve focused on expanding my knowledge and picking up new tools. I’m equally comfortable writing and optimizing production-ready code as I am researching and coming up with new methods. I love bridging research and practice by applying theoretical and mathematical insights in an applied setting. In addition, I’ve strived to gain experience developing in a variety of environments, from mobile applications and web front-ends, to server back-ends and research code.

Of course, the biggest problems and toughest challenges are too much for a single person to tackle. As such, I cherish collaboration and love mentoring and leading dynamic teams. I pride myself on identifying the right person for the task at hand and completing complex projects in a timely manner.
